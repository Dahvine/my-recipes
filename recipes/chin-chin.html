    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups (1kg) plain flour (all purpose flour)</li>
        <li>A tin of Milk</li>
        <li>250g margarine</li>
        <li>Â½ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 eggs (optional)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Measure and Mix dry ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Measure and mix wet ingredients together except butter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add butter to the dry ingredients and mix with your
             fingers until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the other wet ingredients and mix together until dough forms. 
            it should form a perfect dough but if its feels a bit stiff, 
            add a tablespoon of water or milk. if it feels too tacky, 
            add a tablespoon or 2 of flour no more. DO NOT over work the dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap in a saran wrap and allow to rest on the counter for about 5 mins. 
            this allows flavors blend in and develops the gluten which makes it easier
             during the cutting process
        </li>
        <li>
            Unwrap rested dough, you can roll out all the dough at once since dough 
            is small or you can divide into 2 portions and roll individually.
             Roll out dough to about a quarter of an inch thick because dough will
              rise when you fry them.
        </li>
        <li>
            With a knife or pizza cutter or even a dough divider cut dough 
            across vertically and horizontally forming little squares.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put little squares in a bowl and sprinkle a little flour
             on them and shake to prevent sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat up oil. Fry till light golden. Remove with a slotted spoon
             and spread on a paper towel lined tray to cool.
             Chin chin will be soft when hot but hardens as it cools.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
